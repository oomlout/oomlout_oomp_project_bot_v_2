See [this page](https://gondolindrim.github.io/AcheronDocs/madhatter/intro.html) for the Mad Hatter documentation.

## Introduction

The Mad Hatter is an Alice-layout compatible PCB, originally designed by Raphael Faria for the Lubrigante keyboard. Originally it was an Atmega32U4-powered PCB, using USB mini connector and with no per-key lighting support.

It is currently under redesign by Gondolindrim to use STM32F072CBT6 microprocessor and RGB per-key lighting.
