### Description

This little buck converter based on the AP3429A is super handy, taking up to 5.5V input and providing a 3.3V output with up to 1.2A current. It's great for supplying power to popular 3.3V voltage circuits from a range of battery or power options.  This chip provides up to 1.2 Amp load current across the entire input voltage range of 3.4 to 5.5V. It's not a huge range but does cover LiPoly batteries, 3 alkalines, and USB power.

Great for your portable project, we made this "pin compatible" with the LM1117-3.3V TO-220 chip so you can swap it in for better performance (90-95% efficiency!) There's also an ENable pin, tie it low to shut down the output completely.

The Adafruit AP3429A Breakout runs at 1-MHz fixed-frequency. Even though the chip itself supports up to 2A, the inductor we used is small and so the breakout can only provide about 1.2 Amps.
