In 1970, John Conway came up with a 1-player game called [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a mathematical game that simulates 'colonies' that grow or die based on how crowded or lonely they are and is known for the way it creates a beautiful organic display out of randomness.

Here is a design for a simple electronic project that plays Conway's Game of Life. Make one kit and keep it on your desk, or attach multiple kit modules together to create a large display.

Originally created by Dropout Design, this revision adds a few extra features. The kit is very easy to make and an excellent first electronics/soldering project. It is perfect for workshops since at the end everyone can [connect their completed module](https://learn.adafruit.com/game-of-life/) together.

### Features:

- Each kit displays a 4x4 grid (16 LEDs)
- Connect as many kits as youd like, in any configuration, to create a larger game board
- Runs off of 2 AA batteries (not included), but can be easily modified to run off of USB or wall-wart power
- On/Off button to save power, also for resetting the display
- Automatically resets if the colony has died or stagnated (regeneration)
- Backwards compatible with older versions
