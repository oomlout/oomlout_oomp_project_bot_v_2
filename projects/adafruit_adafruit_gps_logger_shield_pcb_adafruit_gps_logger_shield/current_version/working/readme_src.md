Better than ever, our Adafruit assembled GPS shield comes with an Ultimate GPS module. This GPS shield works great with either Adafruit Metro, Arduino UNO or Leonardo and is designed to log data to an SD card. Or you can leave the SD card out and use the GPS for a geocaching project, or maybe a music player that changes tunes depending on where you are in the city.
