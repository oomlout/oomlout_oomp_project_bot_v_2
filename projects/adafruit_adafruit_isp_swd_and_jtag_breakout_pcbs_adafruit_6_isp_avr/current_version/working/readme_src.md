### Descriptions

**AVR ISP:** It's rare to find a mini kit so elegant, it deserves its own Haiku. A simple breakout, 2x3 box header in the center, two 1x3's on the side. Plugs into any breadboard for neat wiring (in both nifty and clean senses of the word).

Comes with a quality mini PCB, a 2x3 box header and a small stick of 0.1" header. Requires some light soldering to use: plug the 2x3 in on the top and solder all six pins, then break the header in half and put each half into a breadboard to hold them steady. Place the breakout on top and solder the side pins. Will last you years and years.

**JTAG to SWD:** This adapter board is designed for adapting a 'classic' 2x10 (0.1"/2.54mm pitch) JTAG cable to a slimmer 2x5 (0.05"/1.27mm pitch) SWD Cable.  It's helpful for using products like the JTAGulator or SEGGER J-Link with tiny boards that use the 10-pin SWD programming connector.

This board comes with no cables.  It's really just the adapter - but is super helpful when you want to use JTAG debugging on boards that can't support 2x10 cables.

**SWD Breakout:** This adapter board is designed to make it easier to use ARM dev boards that use slimmer 2x5 (0.05"/1.27mm pitch) SWD cables for programming.  It's helpful for using products like the JTAGulator, STLink or SEGGER J-Link with tiny boards that use the 10-pin SWD programming connector, often Cortex M0 or M3's.
