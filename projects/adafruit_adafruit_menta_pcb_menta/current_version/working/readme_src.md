Introducing the MENTA, a portable minty Arduino-compatible project that fits into a common mint tin. We took our super popular Boarduino series, and wrapped it with a prototyping area into a rounded PCB that slots directly into an Altoids-sized metal tin. We included everything you expect to jump-start your project:

- DC power adapter jack with polarity protection
- Beefy 1 Amp 5V regulator and 250mA 3.3V regulator for 3.3V devices
- Green power LED, red blinky LED on pin 13
- ISP-6 standard reprogramming header
- FTDI interface plug to connect an [FTDI Friend](http://www.adafruit.com/products/284) or [FTDI Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/products/70)
- Female header set so you can plug standard Arduino-compatible shields in.
- There's four mounting holes if you want to attach it permanently to a box or plate
- Massive prototyping area so you can have the finished project all fit together in a protective box.
- Four rubber bumpers to protect your table from scratching, and the PCB and parts from the metal tin
- [MENTA sticker (unaffixed)](http://www.adafruit.com/products/873)
- __This pack even comes with the mint tin itself!__

Comes as a kit of parts, this is an excellent beginner project, with [step-by-step instructions](http://ladyada.net/make/menta/index.html) even for someone who has never soldered before. [A soldering iron, diagonal cutters and solder](https://www.adafruit.com/category/8) are required to complete the project. You'll also need an FTDI adapter such as the [FTDI Friend](http://www.adafruit.com/products/284) or [FTDI Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/products/70) to program it via the Arduino IDE.
