# Adafruit Motor Shield v1

### This repo is for the now ancient V1 Motor shield.
#### This kit is now discontinued. [We've upgraded the Adafruit Motor Shield v1 to v2, with stacking-support and higher-current motor drivers, Please check out the v2 shield - its much better!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438)

Here is a design for a full-featured motor shield that will be able to power many simple to medium-complexity projects.

- __2 connections for 5V 'hobby' servos__ connected to the Arduino's high-resolution dedicated timer - no jitter!
- 4 H-Bridges: L293D chipset provides 0.6A per bridge (1.2A peak) with thermal shutdown protection, internal kickback protection diodes. Can run motors on 4.5VDC to 25VDC.
- __Up to 4 bi-directional DC__ motors with individual 8-bit speed selection (so, about 0.5% resolution)
- __Up to 2 stepper motors__ (unipolar or bipolar) with single coil, double coil or interleaved stepping.
- Pull down resistors keep motors disabled during power-up
- Big terminal block connectors to easily hook up wires (18-26AWG) and power
- Arduino reset button brought up top
- 2-pin terminal block and jumper to connect external power, for separate logic/motor supplies
- Tested compatible with Arduino Mega 1280 & 2560, Diecimila, Duemilanove, and UNO
- Download the easy-to-use Arduino software library, check out the examples and you're ready to go!

Kit comes with all parts necessary, unassembled. [Instructions, examples, and other documentation is available on the website](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield)

Motors and Arduino are not included.
