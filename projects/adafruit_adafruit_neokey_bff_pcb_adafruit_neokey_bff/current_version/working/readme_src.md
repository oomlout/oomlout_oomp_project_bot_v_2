### Description

Our QT Py boards are a great way to make very small microcontroller projects that pack a ton of power - and now we have a way for you to quickly add a nice mechanical key that also can glow any color of the rainbow. 

We call this the Adafruit NeoKey BFF - a "Best Friend Forever". When you were a kid you may have learned about the "buddy" system, well this product is kinda like that! A board that will watch your QT Py's back and give it more capabilities.

This PCB is designed to fit onto the back of any QT Py or Xiao board; it can be soldered into place or use pin and socket headers to make it removable. Onboard is a Kailh socket, which means you can plug in any MX-compatible switch instead of soldering it in. You may need a little glue to keep the switch in place: hot glue or a dot of epoxy worked fine for us. Also comes with a single reverse-mount NeoPixel pointing up through the spot where many switches would have an LED to shine through.

We include some header that you can solder to your QT Py. You can also pick up an Itsy Bitsy short female header kit to make it removable but compact, you'll just need to trim down the headers to 7 pins long.

The key-switch is default connected to A3 and the NeoPixel to A2 but there are onboard jumpers you can cut to re-configure if you desire.

QT Py is not included.

Please note, each order comes with one assembled PCB and break-off header. A mechanical switch and key cap are not included! Use any MX-compatible switch: Kailh, Gateron, etc all work!
