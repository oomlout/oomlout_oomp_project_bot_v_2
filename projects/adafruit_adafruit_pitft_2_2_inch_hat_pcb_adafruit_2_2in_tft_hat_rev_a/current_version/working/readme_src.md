The cute PiTFT got even more adorable with this little primary display for Raspberry Pi in HAT form! It features a 2.2" display with 320x240 16-bit color pixels. The HAT uses the high speed SPI interface on the Pi and can use the mini display as a console, X window port, displaying images or video etc. Best of all it plugs right in on top of your Model A+ or B+ and fits into our case quite nicely.

It's designed to plug directly onto the Raspberry Pi 2, Pi 3, Pi Zero or Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+ or B+ . While not specifically designed for Pi Model A or B, you can use it with A/B if you solder in an extra-tall 2x13 header (not included) instead of the included 2x20 header

This design uses the hardware SPI pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CE0, CE1) as well as GPIO #25. All other GPIO are unused and are available on a 25-pin long breakout line. Since we had a tiny bit of space, there's 4 flat tactile switches wired to four GPIOs, that you can use if you want to make a basic user interface. For example, you can use one as a power on/off button.

Comes as a fully assembled display PCB and an additional 2x20 GPIO header. Some light soldering is required to attach the 2x20 GPIO header to the HAT but it's fast and easy for anyone with a soldering iron and solder.
