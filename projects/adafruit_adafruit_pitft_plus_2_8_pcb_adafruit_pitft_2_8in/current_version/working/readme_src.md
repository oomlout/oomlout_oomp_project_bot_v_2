### DESCRIPTION
Are these not the cutest little displays for the Raspberry Pi? They feature a 2.8" display with 320x240 16-bit color pixels and a  resistive touchscreen or capacitive touch overlay..

This updated design fits perfectly onto the Pi Zero, Pi 3, Pi 2 or Model A+, B+! (Any Pi with a 2x20 connector) Not for use with an old Pi 1 with 2x13 connector If you'd like to use a 2.8" display with the original Pi A or Pi B, check out the Model B version. This version also has all 40 pins GPIO pins brought out so you can connect a 40-pin GPIO cable underneath. Now that it's the same outline as a Pi 3/2/B+ it fits well on top of a Pi in our Raspberry Pi Enclosure base and can use our faceplate for a compact touchscreen Pi

The display and touchscreen uses the hardware I2C Pins (SDA & SCL), SPI pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CE0) as well as GPIO #25 and #24. All other GPIO are unused and you can still share the I2C pins with sensors, LED drivers, etc. Since we had a tiny bit of space, there's 4 slim tactile switches wired to four GPIOs, that you can use if you want to make a basic user interface. For example, you can use one as a power on/off button.
