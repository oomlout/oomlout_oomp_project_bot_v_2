### Description

This is a great battery-backed real time clock (RTC) that allows your microcontroller project to keep track of time even if it is reprogrammed, or if the power is lost. Perfect for datalogging, clock-building, time stamping, timers and alarms, etc. The DS1307 is the most popular RTC - but it requires 5V power to work (although we've used it with 5V power and 3.3V logic successfully)

Works great with an [Arduino using our RTC library](https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) or with a [Raspberry Pi (or similar single board linux computer)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi)

The DS1307 is simple and inexpensive but not a high precision device. It may lose or gain up to 2 seconds a day. For a high-precision, temperature compensated alternative, [please check out the DS3231 precision RTC](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3013). If you do not need a DS1307, or you need a 3.3V-power/logic capable RTC please check out our affordable [PCF8523 RTC breakout](http://www.adafruit.com/products/3295)
