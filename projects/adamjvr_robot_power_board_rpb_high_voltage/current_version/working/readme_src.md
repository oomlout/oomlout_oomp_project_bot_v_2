# robot-power-board
Power distribution and regulation board for robotics applications

## Specs:
* Main Bus Voltage Range of 30V - 60V, 6 Channels
* X2 Regulated bus voltage Module, 6 Channels each
* STM32F091RCT6 ARM Cortex M0 Monitoring Voltage on all channels and current



## Details
The power board is designed to supply three bus voltages to the system.
The main bus voltage is whatever the input is, with the PCB supporting a
range of 30V-60V. This main bus voltages feeds the two other sections,
which are sockets for Regulated Bus Voltage Modules.

#### Regulated Bus Voltage Module (RBVM)
