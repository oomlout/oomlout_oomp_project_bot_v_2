## **Unified-S9 9V Solenoid Driver**

![Solenoid Driver](https://github.com/ai03-2725/9V-solenoid-controller/blob/master/img/Screenshot_3.png?raw=true)

**Note:** Prototype not confirmed functional. Please modify to function before producing.

Based on [Xwhatit's work](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=58192), modified to work natively through QMK's haptic feedback/solenoid implementation.  
Open-source and extremely compacted to be easily implementable by custom keyboard designers.  

All credits for the original circuitry goes to Xwhatsit (source viewable [here](https://github.com/BASLQC/xwhatits-capsense-controller)).  
Many credits to Gondolindrim and Wilba for assistance along the way.
