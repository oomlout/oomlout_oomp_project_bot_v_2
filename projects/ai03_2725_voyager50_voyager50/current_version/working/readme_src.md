#### In light of recent claims that I am 100% liable for any of my open source PCBs, I am adding this disclaimer.
#### I provide these PCBs as a reference for designing keyboard PCBs. Using them within your projects will require a will to do research of one's own and to learn the workings of them, potentially fixing issues if they exist.
# I provide these PCBs without liability and without any guarantees regarding functionality, as expressed in the MIT license under which all of these PCBs are licensed.
