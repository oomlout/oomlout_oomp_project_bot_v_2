# GH80 series keyboard PCBs for Cherry boards

Please read the license before use. Each board has its own BOM and gerber files included.

These boards have been tested by numerous people, but I cannot guarantee that they work for your board.

I will not help you when you fuck up your soldering work, lol (though I might because I'm just too kind)

Oh by the way, use kicad nightly to open the source files.

## GH80-3000 vs GH80-3003
The 3000 is made by someone else, and the 3003 is mine. See it as my take on the same idea.
