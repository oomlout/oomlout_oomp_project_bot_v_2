## Backpacks

### JACDAC

The JACDAC Connect system uses the JACDAC (Joint Asynchronous Communications) protocol, a single cable transmission protocol for the plug and play of accessories for microcontrollers.

We have adapted this technology to unlock the following benefits:

- No welding between JACDAC breakouts
- Connectors with 3.5mm audio plug to avoid connection errors.
- Ability to create a chain in series where you can connect multiple devices.

### BLE HID
