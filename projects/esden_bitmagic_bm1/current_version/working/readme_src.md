This repository contains files related to the BitMagic hardware.

BitMagic-Basic is a simple USB High Speed Logic Analyzer compatible with [Sigrok](http://sigrok.org) and is based on the [fx2grok-flat](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2grok#fx2grok-flat) design.

BitMagic-One is a faster USB 3.0 SuperSpeed data syphon hardware.

This hardware implements the acquisition of CPU Trace data in combination with [Orbuculum](https://github.com/mubes/orbuculum) and a streaming 32bit logic analyzer in combination with [Sigrok](http://sigrok.org).

This project is aspiring to become a series of open source hardware streaming Logic Analyzers and data syphons compatible with open source software data processors like [Orbuculum](https://github.com/mubes/orbuculum), [Sigrok](http://sigrok.org) and more.
