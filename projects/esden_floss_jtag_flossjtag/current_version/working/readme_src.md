# UART connector adapter side:

| Pin No. | Name  |
|---------|-------|
| 1       | +3.3V |
| 2       |  TXD  |
| 3       |  RXD  |
| 4       |  GND  |

The numbering of the connector is from left to right when looking from the edge
of the board at the pins of the header.

# Hardware design file notes:

All designs up until version 1.0 of Floss-JTAG were
designed in Cadsoft EAGLE. To view the files you will need to install EAGLE.
Most of the designs are 4-layer; this means that you will need a paid version
of the software to edit the inner layers of the board.
