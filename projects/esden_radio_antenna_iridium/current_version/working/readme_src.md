Radio hardware and software projects, by Jared Boone of ShareBrained Technology, Inc.
You'll find software-defined radio designs and breakout boards for interesting components
(bandpass filters, VCO+PLL ICs, mixer ICs, LNAs).

Status
======

I intend to commit only projects that have been fabricated and tested to some extent in
the real world. But do check the README for each project to see more details.

Projects
========

* baseband_digitizer/
 * adc-iq-2185-xp2/: An 80MHz+ quadrature sampler using an FPGA and high-speed USB.
_
* front_end/
 * adrf6850-breakout/: Breakout board for the ADRF6850 100MHz to 1GHz receiver IC.

* vco_pll/
 * adf4350-breakout/: Breakout board for the ADF4350 VCO+PLL, tuning from 137.5MHz
   up to 4.4GHz.
