This picture shows an early design of the I/O board by LA2NI

This I/O board is part of a set consisting of a 400 W LDMos based RF power amplifier (Munin 400), 
a medium power (600 or 1500 W) Zolotarev low pass filter, an Automatic Antenna Tuner (ATU) nickname « Aries » 
and a 4 port antenna switch.

All these developments are the work and intellectual property of Kjell Karlsen LA2NI and Laurence Barker G8NJJ.

The I/O board ensures the physical link between the transceiver and the "Munin400/Aries" RF system

For more information, please refer to the Aries documentation (in the G8NJJ github repository)


This board was originally developed in September 2021 by Kjell LA2NI , with UltiBoard EDA. A very early release has been designed
using KiCAD EDA. After some test on a prototype setup, it has been decided to extend this board to offer both P1/output jack and
the full set of J1 signal output and a 12V switched power supply rail for the OpenHPSDR Andromeda interface. All internal or external
"tune" trace that can be found on the original f5 release of the I/O board schematic have been deleted

Gerber files could be downloaded at https://github.com/F6ITU/K_IO_Board/tree/main/Gerber 

An interactive BOM is also available https://github.com/F6ITU/K_IO_Board/tree/main/iBom

This version is -so far- considered as a "final and usable" version. As usual, all improvement suggestions are welcome.
