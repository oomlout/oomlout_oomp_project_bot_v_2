# K_Munin400
LA2NI's OpenHPSDR 400W HF amplifier (Kicad Version)

![Munin, a 400W HF linear amplifier](https://github.com/F6ITU/K_Munin400/blob/main/K_Munin400.png)

This amplifier board is part of a set consisting of a 400 W LD-Mos based RF power amplifier (Munin 400), 
a medium power Zolotarev low pass filter (600 or 1500 W), an Automatic Antenna Tuner (ATU) nickname « Aries » 
and a 4 port antenna switch.

All these developments are the work and intellectual property of Kjell Karlsen LA2NI and Laurence Barker G8NJJ.

Munin and Hugin are the two "messenger" ravens of the Norse god Odin - just as Hermes is the messenger-god in Greek mythology, 
and the masterpiece of the OpenHPSDR architecture 

This LDMoS transistor-based amplifier brings speech over the great distances of the "Midgard" of the waves
