AntBrain Robot Controller
==========================
Copyright 2018 Freetronics Pty Ltd  www.freetronics.com  

The AntBrain is a tiny robot controller intended for ant-weight class
combat robots.

It uses the same ATmega328P MCU as the Arduino Uno, and adds 2 H-bridge
motor controllers to drive wheels and a servo output to control a
weapon. A radio control receiver mounts directly onto the board so the
Arduino can read the control signals.

Features:

 * ATmega328P MCU
 * 2 x L9110S H-bridge motor drivers
 * Mount for Flysky radio receiver
 * Servo output
