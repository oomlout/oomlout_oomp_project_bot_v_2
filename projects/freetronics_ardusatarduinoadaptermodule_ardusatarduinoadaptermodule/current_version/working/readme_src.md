Freetronics ArduSat Arduino Adapter Module
==========================================
Copyright 2012 Freetronics Pty Ltd   www.freetronics.com  

CubeSat-compatible module that allows an Arduino or compatible board
to be plugged in upside down. All Arduino headers and CubeSat bus
headers are broken out to allow you to quickly hook any Arduino
model with Uno-compatible headers into a satellite stack.

Includes prototyping area to add your own parts.

Features:

 * CubeSat bus fully broken out, with CubeSat 5V and 3.3V duplicated.
 * Jumpers to allow easy linkage of Arduino and CubeSat power rails.
 * 5V and 3.3V "power on" LEDs.
 * Reset button connected to Arduino reset pin.
 * Parts overlay on both the top and the bottom so you can see what you
   are connecting without having to keep turning the board over.
 * Prototyping area.
 * Gold-plated PCB surface.
