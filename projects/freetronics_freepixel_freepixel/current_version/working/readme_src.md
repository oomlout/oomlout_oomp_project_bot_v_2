This is an LED with a brain! Includes a bright RGB LED with a built-in
WS2812B constant-current, addressable, multi-channel LED driver. This
smart module can be daisy-chained, so you can connect a number of these
together in a string and drive each of the module colours individually
from your microcontroller.

Compatible with various Arduino libraries for the WS2812B, including
the FastLED library and the NeoPixel library.

Features:

 * Requires just 1 data connections.
 * Input and output headers on opposite sides of the board for easy
   daisy-chaining.
