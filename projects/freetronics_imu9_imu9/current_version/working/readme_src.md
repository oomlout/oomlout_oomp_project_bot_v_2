Design files for the Freetronics IMU9 - a 9-DOF IMU with I2C interface.

Combining an accelerometer, a magnetometer, and a gyroscope all in one tiny package with an Arduino-friendly I2C interface.

Perfect for building an autopilot for a quadcopter, or tracking the position of a robot, or logging data in a rocket. Combine three axis data from each of the sensors for a total of 9 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of tracking.
