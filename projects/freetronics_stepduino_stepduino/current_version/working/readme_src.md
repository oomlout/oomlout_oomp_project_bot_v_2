The StepDuino is an Arduino-compatible board with two onboard stepper
motor drivers, a 20x4 LCD, servo outputs, and an SD card slot. This
makes it ideal for mechatronics projects such as small robots or 2D
plotters.

It uses the same ATmega328P MCU as the Arduino Uno reference design,
and includes an ATmega16u2 USB-to-serial converter just like the Uno.
You can therefore program it the same way as you would an Uno, but
with the benefit of all the extra features built in to the StepDuino.

Features:

 * 2 x 4-wire stepper motor drivers
 * 20x4 LCD
 * Micro SD card slot
 * Analog inputs for use with Nintendo DS touch screen or other sensors
