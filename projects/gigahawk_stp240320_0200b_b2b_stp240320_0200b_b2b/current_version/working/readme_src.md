# STP240320_0200B_b2b

A PCB that adapts the ribbon connector of the STP240320_0200B_b2b to a [Molex SlimStack 55560-0168](https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/pcb_headers/0555600168)
> The footprint used is the KiCad native [55560-0161](https://gitlab.com/kicad/libraries/kicad-footprints/-/blob/master/Connector_Molex.pretty/Molex_SlimStack_55560-0161_2x08_P0.50mm_Vertical.kicad_mod), there doesn't seem to be an appreciable difference.

## Background

The STP240320_0200B is a 2.0" 240x320 ST7789 based TFT display.
It is used in many 2.0" ST7789 display modules, some examples:
- [Adafruit 2.0" 320x240 Color IPS TFT Display with microSD Card Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4311)
- [Waveshare 240Ã—320, General 2inch IPS LCD Display Module](https://www.waveshare.com/2inch-lcd-module.htm)

The display itself can be purchased from [Surenoo Display on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000469644849.html), if you find other vendors please feel free to open an issue or PR.

The flex ribbon connector isn't designed to go into a FFC connector, so this board is used to connectorize the display.

### Update 2022-10-27
I have recently purchased more of these displays and they are not the same as the displays I originally purchased back in 2020, nor do they match the picture in the listing.

Original is on the left, the display I recently received on the right:
![comparison_front](./images/comparison_front.jpg)
![comparison_rear](./images/comparison_rear.jpg)

While I have not tested this new display with the adapter, visually they appear to be functionally identical.
The display housing has the exact same outer dimensions.
The connector has the same number of pins with the same pitch and in the same order.
The connector location relative to the display housing appears to be the same as well

Since I have not tested the display yet with the breakout, I do not know whether:
- The pinout of the connector is actually identical to the original
- The viewing area location matches the original display

## STP240320_0200B_b2b

The `STP240320_0200B_b2b` folder contains KiCad files for the board to board adapter shown above

## STP240320_0200B_b2b_breakout

The `STP240320_0200B_b2b_breakout` folder contains KiCad files for a breakout board similar to the Adafruit breakout with a matching [Molex SlimStack 54722-0164](https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/pcb_receptacles/0547220164).

## Notes

There appear to be similar displays with SPI interfaces that have FPCs suitable for direct connection into an FFC connector.

The STP240320_0200A sold from the same link above is listed as an 8-bit parallel interface only, but the display looks suspiciously close to some other listings on AliExpress:
- https://www.aliexpress.com/i/1005003204020216.html
- https://www.aliexpress.com/i/2045504893.html

These listings list pins 3 and 4 as `IM1` and `IM2`, which can be used to set the display mode to 8-bit parallel or SPI.

[LCD Wiki](http://www.lcdwiki.com/2.0inch_IPS_Module) documents a breakout board using this display, with a [schematic](http://www.lcdwiki.com/res/MSP2008/2.0IPS_MSP2008_Schematic.pdf) showing the `IMx` pins configuring the display for SPI operation.
The schematic has a link to http://www.qdtft.com, but they don't seem to list this module anymore.

There are a few vendors on AliExpress that appear to be selling this breakout:

- https://www.aliexpress.com/i/1005004116832438.html

### Update 2022-11-05

I've purchased breakouts from the first link in the above list (XunMing Store), some notes about them:
- They work identically to the STP240320_0200B
    - Tested using Adafruit's [CircuitPython Displayio Quickstart Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/2-0-inch-320-x-240-color-ips-tft-display/circuitpython-displayio-quickstart)
- The breakout boards use a rather strong foam tape that makes the display hard to separate from the PCB, if possible I recommend purchasing the bare display module on its own for integration into other projects, and to use the breakout only for prototyping
- The display module is significantly larger in all dimensions compared to the STP240320_0200B
    - The bezels are significantly larger, and the whole module is thicker
- The FFC connector used does not save any space compared to the SlimStack connector used.
    - When fully assembled (i.e. B2B adapter connected to the breakout), the SlimStack connectors are about the same height as the closed FFC connector
    - The FFC connector is significantly wider than both the SlimStack connector and the B2B adapter board (perpendicular to the direction of FFC insertion)
    - The FFC connector is about the same length of the B2B adapter board (parallel to the direction of FFC insertion)
