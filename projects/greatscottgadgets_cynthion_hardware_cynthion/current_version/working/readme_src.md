# Cynthion: hardware design for a USB test instrument

Cynthion is an open source hardware tool for building, testing, monitoring, and experimenting with USB devices. It is the primary platform for the [LUNA](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/luna) USB gateware library based on [Amaranth HDL](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth).

Cynthion is designed in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), an open source electronic design automation package.
