Daisho
======

Daisho is a SuperSpeed USB 3.0 FPGA platform.  The Daisho Platform is intended
for operation as a pair of components:

A mainboard with an FPGA can connect to a back-end computer via SuperSpeed USB.

A front-end board for a particular application connects to the mainboard via a
high speed parallel connector.

Front-end boards are planned that enable in-line monitoring and injection for
high speed wired communication media.
