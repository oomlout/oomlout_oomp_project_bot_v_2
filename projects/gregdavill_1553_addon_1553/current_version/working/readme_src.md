This is an addon for the Glasgow https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/glasgow to be able to talk to 1553 networks.

This was inspired by http://stevenmerrifield.com/1553/index.html

Not sure we need the buffer chip nc7wz16p6x https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/NC7WZ16-D.PDF since the glasgow has a buffer. Should just be able to use the SC-70-6 footprint.

We need the make sure that the foot print works big thanks to @kevinneubauer for his work. https://www.murata-ps.com/datasheet?/data/magnetics/kmp_786j.pdf

I still need to make the footprint for each chip and finish the this so A LOT MORE WORK TO DO.
