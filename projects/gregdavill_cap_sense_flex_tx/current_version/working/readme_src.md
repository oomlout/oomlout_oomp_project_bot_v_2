A prototype of a flex measuring sensor.
Based off: [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376269](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376269)

This design will attempt to utilise OSHPark Flex for the sensor elements, which provides a low cost solution for prototyping flexible circuits. But you are limited to a 5mil polymide core.
