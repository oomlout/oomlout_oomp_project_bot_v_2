# PIC Bench Power Supply display

This is a volt/ammeter display for bench power supplies, based on PIC18F2550.
It is originally designed as a replacement for old power supplies whose displays
are damaged.

Firmware is developed using MPLAB XC8 Compiler (through MPLAB X IDE), based
on some of [my own libraries].

Schematics and PCB are designed using [KiCAD]. Some components were taken from
my KiCAD libraries: [gtrzps-kicad-symbols] and [gtrz.pretty].
