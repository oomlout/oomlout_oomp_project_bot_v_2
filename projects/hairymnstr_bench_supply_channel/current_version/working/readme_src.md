Bench Supply
============

This is a fairly basic bench power supply project I'm working on.  It started
off as a one-off design with all through-hole and stripboard construction but
I'm probably going to get the channels at least done on a PCB to make it more
robust.

All done in KiCAD so far, there will be some software for driving the current
and voltage displays later on.  There are two projects so far, the control
board which is a one-off that does non channel specific things like output on
off control, and a channel design which I'm using twice to provide two
separate floating supply rails.
