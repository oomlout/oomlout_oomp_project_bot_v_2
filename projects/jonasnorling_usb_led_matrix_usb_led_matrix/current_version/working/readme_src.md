A USB connected LED matrix
==========================

This is a quick holidays project from 2020/2021. It is a 8Ã—8 SMD LED matrix board with a STM32G4 and USB-C connector.

What it does is up to the software but currently I use it to display CPU load on my PC. When not connected to a USB host it displays a calm animation.
