# 5uH-DC-LISN
5uH DC LISN (-10 dB attenuation)

This LISN enables you to perform basic EMC testing with your DC devices, e.g. power supplies.

The layout (especially the attenuation) is based on Linear Technology DC2130A board design and a [thread in the EEVblog forum](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/5uh-lisn-for-spectrum-analyzer-emcemi-work/msg404662/#msg404662).

Further information on EMC testing can be found in [WÃ¼rth Application Note ANP005](http://www.we-online.de/web/en/electronic_components/produkte_pb/application_notes/emv_filter_fuer_dc_dc_schaltregler_optimiert.php).
