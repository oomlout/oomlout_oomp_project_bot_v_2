# PWM Solar Charge Controller (10-20A)

![Development Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20stage-eval-yellow.svg) Tested prototype, only minor issues left.

This PWM charge controller is cheaper than the MPPT charge controllers, as it does not contain the internal powerful DC/DC converter necessary for MPPT. The lower production cost and easy manufacturing with larger SMD components makes it ideally suited for solar home systems (SHS) for rural electrification.

The design allows to use either SMD MOSFETs or TO220 THT MOSFETs, which can be easily attached to a heat sink.
