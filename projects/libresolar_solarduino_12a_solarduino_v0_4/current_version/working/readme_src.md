# Solarduino_12A
12A MPPT solar charge controller based on Arduino

Features: 
- 12A MPPT charger
- 55V max PV input
- 12V or 24V battery output
- Arduino-compatible (ATmega 328P used)
- Expandable via break-out of unused ports to standard 2.54 pin-pitch headers (e.g. used for display, communication like CAN/RS485, etc.)

Built-in protection:
- Overvoltage
- Undervoltage
- Overcurrent
- PV short circuit
- PV reverse polarity (for max. module open circuit voltage of around 40V)
- Battery reverse polarity (destructive, fuse is blown)

# Roadmap
- This is the new version of the charge controller. First PCB was sent to production beginning of May 2016. First test results end of May expected.
