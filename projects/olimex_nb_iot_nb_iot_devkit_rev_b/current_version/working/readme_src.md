# NB-IoT
NB-IoT is LPWAN technology for IoT with many advantages over LoRa and SigFox.

NB-IoT technology works over existing GSM network. This means all existing GSM networks with LTE can support NB-IoT if the protocol is installed by your GSM operator.
One base cell can talk up to 100 000 NB-IoT nodes. One base cell can establish connection in urban area 1-10km and in rural area 10-100km
One NB-IoT node can last on battery up to 10 years if less 200 bytes per day are transmitted
