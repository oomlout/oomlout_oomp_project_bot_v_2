This is the official repository for a number of OLIMEXINO-85 boards, manufactured by Olimex.

OLIMEXINO-85 boards are very tiny Arduino-like boards. They have functionality similar to Digistump's Digispark and Adafruitâ€™s Trinket. The ATtiny85 microcontroller of each board comes preprogrammed with "Micronucleus" bootloater. This bootloader allows you to upload new software to the board via a personal computer and a USB cable. The boards work with the same Arduino distribution as Digispark.

In this repository you would find files suitable for the following boards:
