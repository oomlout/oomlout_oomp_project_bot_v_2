The LumenPnP Feeders are open source pick and place feeders to aid in [Mid-Scale Manufacturing](https://stephenhawes.com/level-2-manufacturing/).

LumenPnP Feeders are available for sale on the [Opulo Website](https://www.opulo.io/). If you build or buy one, please help the project by documenting bugs with a GitHub issue.

The LumenPnP Feeders run [Photon](https://github.com/photonfirmware/photon), an open source firmware project for pick and place feeders. The popular pick and place control software [OpenPnP](https://openpnp.org/) has Photon support built in, so it's easy to get going with the LumenPnP feeders using your existing OpenPnP setup. These feeders are designed to work with the [LumenPnP](https://opulo.io/products/lumenpnp).

The development process is being cataloged in a series of videos. A playlist of these can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIeJXmcg1baLBz3x0nCDqkYpKs2IWGHk4).
