# Hardware

This repository contains the designs for any physical hardware -- most notably the custom adapter board that sits on the Romi platform connecting the Romi, Raspberry Pi, and TinyFPGA BX, and sensors together.

## pcb/tinyfpga-raspi-romi-board
These are the KiCad design files for the PCB. It's designed as follows:

* The Romi chassis needs to have the combined power distribution board and motor controller
* The Romi PDB/MC's onboard regulator **NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED TO 3.3V OUTPUT OR EVERYTHING WILL BREAK AND YOU WILL BE SAD**
  * This is accomplished by cutting the "VREG Select" trace with an exacto knife. 
* Male headers need to be installed into the following locations (add a picture here....)
  * PWMR / DIRR / nSLPR / GND
  * PWML / DIRL / nSLPL / GND
  * ERA / ERB / GND
  * ELA / ELB / GND
  * 3x VSW / 3x GND
* The custom board should have female headers installed which mate with the male headers on the PDB/MC board
* The raspberry pi and tinyfpga plug into the custom board
