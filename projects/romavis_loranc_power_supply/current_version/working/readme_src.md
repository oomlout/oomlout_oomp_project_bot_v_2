LORAN C (USSR "Chayka") receiver project
----

####Initial idea of project:
To build Loran-C navigational receiver with digital signal processing.  
Loran-C is (was?) a ground-based longwave navigational system working on frequency of 100 KHz, that was heavely used both by civilians and military prior to wide GPS adoption.

Receiver should also be able to lock onto signal of USSR "Chayka" system, similar to Loran-C, due to my location (nearest transmitter chain is "Chayka" GRI 8000)
