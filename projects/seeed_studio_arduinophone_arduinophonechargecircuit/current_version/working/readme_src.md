Combining Arduino and other shield modules, we make a mobile phone named Arduino Phone. Meanwhile, we printed a shell for it with the 3D printer. Although it’s not such fine as you think, even a little bit clunky, it’s still very cool. That is the point this is a cell phone made by ourselves.

### Usage:

This is a Sketchbook of Arduino.([How to use Sketchbook](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/How_To_Use_Sketchbook "How to use Sketchbook"))

This Sketchbook includes a Phone demo and some libraries that included. 

We had an instructable about how to make an Arduino Phone, for more information, please refer to [Arduino Phone Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/ArduinoPhone/)


### TFT Shield version

The default TFT version is TFT Touch Shield V2, if you want to work with TFT v1, there's few to be modify in the code.
