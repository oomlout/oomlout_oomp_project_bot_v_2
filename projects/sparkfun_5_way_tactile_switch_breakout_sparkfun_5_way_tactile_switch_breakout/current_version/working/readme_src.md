[*SparkFun 5-Way Tactile Switch Breakout (BOB-11187)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11187)

This 5-way tactile switch (up, down, left, right, and center click) allows for joystick-like control in a very small package. 
This breadboard-friendly board breaks out all the switch signals, and includes pullup resistors configured so that the outputs read low when pressed, and high otherwise.
