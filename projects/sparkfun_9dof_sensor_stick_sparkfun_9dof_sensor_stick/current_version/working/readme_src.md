The SparkFun 9DOF Sensor Stick is a very small sensor board with 9 degrees of freedom.
It includes the LSM9DS1 with a simple I2C interface and a mounting hole for attaching it to your project.
Also, the board is a mere 0.9" in length, 0.4" in width, and 0.036" thick (0.093" overall), allowing it to be easily mounted in just about any application.
