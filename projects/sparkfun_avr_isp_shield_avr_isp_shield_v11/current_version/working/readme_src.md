[*SparkFun AVR ISP Shield (DEV-11168)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11168)

This shield, once assembled, gives your Arduino a 28-pin ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) socket so it can grab onto unsuspecting ICs. 
The socket is wired to work directly with the ArduinoISP code, but burning bootloaders isn’t the only thing you can do with it. 
We’ve also connected the serial I/Os so that if you’re a programming ninja you can do cool tricks like programming ICs using the bootloader on-the-go.
