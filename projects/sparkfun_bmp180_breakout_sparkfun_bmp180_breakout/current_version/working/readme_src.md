Arduino library installation:
-------------------

This archive contains an Arduino library and example sketch showing how to use this sensor. The library must be installed onto your computer in order for the example code to work correctly.

If you haven't, install the free Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), available at [www.arduino.cc](http://www.arduino.cc). This code was written using Arduino version 1.0.5. and updated to be used with the Arduino library manager of version 1.6.3.

To install without the manager, download the Arduino folder then use the Arduino IDE to add it.  From the IDE, go Sketch->Include Library->"Add .ZIP Library", then choose the Arduino folder that was downloaded.  The IDE will pick proper names from the library.properties file and put the libraries in your user sketch folder.

Teensy library installation:
-------------------

[A. Faruk](https://github.com/unalfaruk) was kind enough to create a version of this library for the [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) microcontroller family. You can find information on installation and use of this library at: https://github.com/sparkfun/BMP180_Breakout/tree/master/Libraries/Teensy

Running the example sketch:
-------------------

<ol start=1>
<li>Connect the BMP180 breakout board to your Arduino. You can solder wires, use jumper wires and headers, etc.
<p>
"-" (GND) to GND
<br>
"+" (VDD) to 3.3V
<p>
(WARNING: do not connect "+" to 5V or the sensor will be damaged!)
<p>
You will also need to connect the I2C pins (SCL and SDA) to your Arduino.
These pins are different on different Arduino models:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Any Arduino</td>
<td>SDA&nbsp;</td>
<td>SCL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Uno, Redboard, Pro/Mini&nbsp;</td>
<td>A4</td>
<td>A5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mega2560, Due</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leonardo, Pro/Micro</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Leave the IO (VDDIO) pin unconnected. This pin is for connecting
the BMP180 to systems with lower logic levels such as 1.8V.
</li>
<li>
Connect your Arduino to your computer.
<p>
</li>
<li>
Start the Arduino IDE. Select the proper COM port and board type.
<p>
</li>
<li>
In the Arduino IDE, go to the File menu, and down to Examples/SFE_BMP180/SFE_BMP180_example. If you do not see this item, you likely did not install the library properly. See above.
<p>
</li>
<li>
Upload the sketch to your Arduino.
<p>
</li>
<li>
Open the Serial Monitor window (magnifying glass icon un upper right of IDE).
<p>
</li>
<li>
Set the Serial Monitor to 9600 baud (menu in bottom right).
<p>
</li>
</ol>
You should now be seeing pressure measurements in the Serial Monitor window. If you see errors, you may not have connected the BMP180 Breakout Board to your Arduino properly. See step 1 above.
