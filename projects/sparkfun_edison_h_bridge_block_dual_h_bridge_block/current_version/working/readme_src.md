Dual H-bridge
=====================

The Dual H-bridge give the Edison some ability to move when paired with two DC motors.  This board can drive two DC motors at voltages ranging from 2.7V-15V and currents up to 1amp.  This board is isolated from the Edison using a logic level converter.  To use this board external power for the motors will be required.  Power for the motors is supplied on the headers labled "VIN" and "GND"
