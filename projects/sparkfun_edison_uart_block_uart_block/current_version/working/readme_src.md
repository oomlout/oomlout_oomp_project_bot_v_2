[*SparkFun Edison UART Block(DEV-13040)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13040)

The Console Basic expansion board delivers power to the Intel Edison while providing a simple console interface via a user's FTDI cable. This is the most minimal solution to get started using the Intel Edison. The Console Basic board can supply 4V and up to 500mA of current to power the Edison and any other expansion boards you may add to your stack. This power is passed through the VSYS line of the Edison.  This is a great board for low power applications that won't require constant console access.  By removing the FTDI USB-UART from the board, current consumption is minimal.  When the FTDI cable is not inserted, it will be necessary to provide external power to the board.
