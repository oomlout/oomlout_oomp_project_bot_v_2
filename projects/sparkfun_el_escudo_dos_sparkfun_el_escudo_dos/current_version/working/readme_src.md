The SparkFun EL Escudo Dos is an Arduino shield for controlling up to eight strands of electroluminescent wire. 
EL wire is flexible plastic cord that glows brightly when high-voltage AC is applied to it.
The El Escudo Dos contains circuitry to safely switch high-voltage AC on and off, allowing you to create animated displays or whatever else your imagination can come up with.
