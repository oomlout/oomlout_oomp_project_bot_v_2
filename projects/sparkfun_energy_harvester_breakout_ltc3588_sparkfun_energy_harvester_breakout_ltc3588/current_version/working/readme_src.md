[*SparkFun Energy Harvester Breakout - LTC3588 (BOB-09946)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9946)

This breakout board uses the LTC3588 Piezoelectric Energy Harvester from Linear Technologies. 
This board can be used not only for harvesting piezoelectric energy, but solar energy as well. 
There is a bridge rectified input for piezo elements (PZ1 and PZ2) and a direct input (VIN) for DC sources. 
Both are clamped to 20V. 
In addition, the board can simply be used as a standalone nanopower buck regulator.
