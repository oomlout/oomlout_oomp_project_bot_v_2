The [ESP32 Thing Motion Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14430) is a versatile addition to our [ESP32 Thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13907).  Small movements can be detected with the tried and true LSM9DS1 IMU, large movements and time can be detected with the addition of a GPS sensor.  There's a port for the [GP-20U7](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13740) module, and breakout pins for any serial device.  Data can be easily logged by adding an microSD card to the slot.  There is also an additional user led on pin 13.
