[*SparkFun FM Tuner Basic Breakout - Si4703 (BOB-11083)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11083)

This breakout for the Silicon Laboratories Si4703 FM tuner chip is a little more stripped down than our FM Tuner Evaluation Board. If your project already has an amp and just needs a full-featured FM tuner, this is the board for you. 

_Note: If you are using a different microcontroller that is 5V, you will need to connect to the [respective I2C pins](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/wire), and match the [logic levels](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logic-levels). Make sure to add the [4-channel bi-directional logic level converter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009) between SDIO, SCLK, RST, and GPIO2._
