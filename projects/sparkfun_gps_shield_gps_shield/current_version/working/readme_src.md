[*SparkFun GPS Shield (GPS-13750)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13750)

The [SparkFun GPS Logger Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13750) equips your Arduino with access to a GPS module, µSD memory card socket, and all of the other peripherals you'll need to turn your Arduino into a position-tracking, speed-monitoring, altitude-observing wonder logger. The shield is based around a [GP3906-TLP GPS Module](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/6/8/GP3906-TLP_DataSheet_Rev_A01.pdf) -- a 66-channel GPS receiver featuring a MediaTek MT3339 architecture and an up to 10Hz update rate.
