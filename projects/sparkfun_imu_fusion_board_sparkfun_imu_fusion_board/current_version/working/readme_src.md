[*SparkFun IMU Fusion Board - ADXL345 & IMU3000 (SEN-10252)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10252)

The IMU 3000 breakout features a 3-axis MEMS digital gyro with programmable ranges from +-250 to +-2000 degrees/sec. 
In addition, it has a secondary I2C port that interfaces with a digital accelerometer to deliver a complete 6-axis sensor output from its primary I2C port. 
The fusion output offloads the intensive motion processing computation requirements from the host processor, reducing the need for frequent polling of the motion sensor output and enabling low cost, low power microcontrollers.
