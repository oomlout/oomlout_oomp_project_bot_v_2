[*LilyPad Arduino SimpleSnap (DEV-10941)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10941)

 The SimpleSnap board is similar to the LilyPad Simple board, and has the same functionality except for two major differences: A built-in rechargeable Lithium Polymer battery and female snap connectors. 
 By adding fabric snaps to the board, LilyPadâ€™s made it possible to connect this board to the SimpleSnap Protoboard or simply an arrangement of sew-on fabric snaps so that the board is removable from your project for washing or so that multiple projects can share a board!
