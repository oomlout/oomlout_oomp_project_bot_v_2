[*LilyPad SimpleSnap Protoboard (DEV-10940)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10940)

The SimpleSnap Protoboard is made to connect to the SimpleSnap main board so that the board is removable from your project for washing or so that multiple projects can share a board! 
The ring of male snap connectors on the SimpleSnap Protoboard mate directly to the LilyPad SimpleSnap main board, just sew the Protoboard to your project and the main board can be attached and removed easily from your project without ripping stitches!
