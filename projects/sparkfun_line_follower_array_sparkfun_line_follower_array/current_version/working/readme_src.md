[*SparkFun Line Follower Array (SEN-13582)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13582)

The Sensor Bar takes an 8 bit reading of reflectance for use with following lines or reading dark/light patterns.  The bar can see from about 1/4 to 3/4 inches away.  IR illumination power can be adjusted with the on-board potentiometer.  Illumination can be turned on and off with software to conserve power, or left on all the time for faster readings.
