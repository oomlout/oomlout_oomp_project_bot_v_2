[*SparkFun LiPo Charger Basic - Micro-USB (PRT-10217)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10217)

The SparkFun LiPo Charger Basic is stripped down of all features and just does one thing well - charge 3.7V LiPo cells at a rate of 500mA. 
It is designed to charge single-cell Li-Ion or Li-Polymer batteries. 
The board incorporates a charging circuit, status LED, connector for your battery (JST-type used in the batteries we carry), and a micro-USB connector. 
A small mounting hole allows this charger to be easily embedded into a project.
