[*SparkFun Mini FET Shield (DEV-09627)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9627)

 Developed by Dave Vondle and IDEO Labs, this board is essentially the same as our Power Driver Shield, but the through-hole parts have been switched out for smaller SMD construction, allowing you to to drive high-current switches with your Arduino Pro Mini. 
 This is a great shield for small prototyping.
