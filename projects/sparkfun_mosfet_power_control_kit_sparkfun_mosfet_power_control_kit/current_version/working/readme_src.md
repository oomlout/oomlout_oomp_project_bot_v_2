[*SparkFun MOSFET Power Control Kit (COM-12959)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12959)

This is the SparkFun MOSFET Power Control Kit, a breakout PTH soldering kit for for the RFP30N06LE N-Channel MOSFET.
What we really like about this particular MOSFET is that itâ€™s very common and offers very low on-resistance with a control 
(gate) voltage that is compatible with any 3-5V microcontroller or mechanical switch. This allows you to control high-power
 devices with very low-power control mechanisms.
