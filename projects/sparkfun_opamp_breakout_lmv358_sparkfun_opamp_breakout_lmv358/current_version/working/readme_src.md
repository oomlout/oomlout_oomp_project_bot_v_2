[*SparkFun OpAmp Breakout - LMV358 (BOB-09816)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9816)

 This is a simple Op Amp breakout board, set up as a 2-stage amplifier with a gain of 100 (gain of 10 for each stage). 
 The on-board trim pot sets the signal level between the stages, not the feedback path. 
 The bandwidth is set to 15.9kHz by a pair of feedback capacitors, or over 100kHz with the caps removed. 
 The LMV358 opamp can source up to 160mA and works well as a low impedance driver/buffer.
