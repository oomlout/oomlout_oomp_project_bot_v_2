*OpenSegment Serial Display (Yellow) (COM-11645)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11645)

OpenSegment is a ATmega328 based backpack for larger 7-segment displays. The ATmega receives data over digital interfaces (such as TWI, UART, SPI and buttons) and does all the PWM and upkeep of the display. 

Larger 7-segment displays pull more power than a microcontroller is able to drive directly. OpenSegment has 8 PNP and 4 NPN transistors in order to drive the segments at their maximum brightness.

**Features:**
* Standard FTDI connection
* Arduino Pro Mini @ 8MHz bootloader
* 5V functionality

This part was created in Eagle 6.3
