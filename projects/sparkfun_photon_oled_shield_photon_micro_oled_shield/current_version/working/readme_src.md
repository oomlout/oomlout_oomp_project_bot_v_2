[*SparkFun Photon OLED Shield (DEV-13628)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13628)

The [SparkFun Photon OLED Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13231) breaks out a small monochrome, blue-on-black OLED to use with your Photon module. It’s “micro”, but it still packs a punch – the OLED display is crisp, and you can fit a deceivingly large amount of graphics on there. This shield is perfect for adding graphics to your Photon, displaying diagnostic information without resorting to serial output, and teaching a little game theory.
