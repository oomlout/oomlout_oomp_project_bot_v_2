The Pi Servo pHAT is a hat that adds, via I<sup>2</sup>C, the ability to control up to 16 servo motors with a Raspberry Pi. It is the same size and form factor as a Pi Zero or Pi Zero W. The Pi Servo pHAT is great for adding pan/tilt control with the Raspberry Pi Camera to create homemade motion-activated security systems, webcam interfaces for streaming, or monitoring stations for any number of projects and adventures.
