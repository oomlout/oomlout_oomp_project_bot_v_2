[*Pioneer IoT Kit Shield (DEV-14531)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14531)

The Pioneer IoT Add-On Shield is a unique board designed to add more functionality to the PSoC 6 from Cypress while remaining useful and practical for plenty of other Internet of Things applications. Each Add-On Shield is a pretty simple board with an equally simple layout that provides XBee, Qwiic and microSD functionality not only to the PSoC 6 but also to any board with an Arduino R3 shield format.
