[*ProtoScrewShield (DEV-09729)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9729)

The ScrewShield extends all pins of the Arduino out to 3.5mm pitch screw terminals. 
It also has a lot of the utility provided by Arduino Protoshield, including: a large prototyping space of both connected and unconnected 0.1" spaced through-holes, a couple 5V and GND busses, a reset button, general use push button, and a 5mm yellow LED.
