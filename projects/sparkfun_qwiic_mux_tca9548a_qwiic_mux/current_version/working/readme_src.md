The Qwiic Mux Breakout enables communication with multiple I2C devices that have the same address and gets them all talking on the same bus! The Qwiic Mux also has eight configurable addresses of its own, allowing for up to 64 I2C buses on a connection. To make it even easier to use this multiplexer, all communication is enacted exclusively via I2C, utilizing our handy Qwiic system.
