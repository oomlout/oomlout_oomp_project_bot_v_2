The future is here! You asked and we delivered - our Qwiic Transparent Graphical OLED Breakout allows you to display custom images on a transparent screen using either SPI or I<sup>2</sup>C connections. 

With Qwiic connectors it's quick (ha ha) and easy to get started with your own images. However, we still have broken out 0.1"-spaced pins in case you prefer to use a breadboard. Brilliantly lit in the dark and still visible by daylight, this OLED sports a display area of 128x64 pixels, 128x56 of which are completely transparent. Control of the OLED is based on our new HyperDisplay library. 

The Arduino sketch required to drive this display requires quite a bit of dynamic memory, meaning that it is not going to fit on a smaller controller like an ATmega328. Any controller with larger RAM should have no problem. In addition, your 3.3v source should be robust enough to supply around 400mA to the display.
