[*SparkFun RFM22 Shield - 434MHz (DEV-11018)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11018)

The RFM22 Shield connects the RFM22 module to the appropriate lines on the Arduino. 
By using the RF22 Library, you can send and receive messages via standard 4-wire SPI. 
The library includes command structures for setting up anything from simple non-addressed point-to-point communication to fully addressed networks of clients and routers. 
The shield also provides a through-hole antenna connection for hooking up a basic wire antenna.
