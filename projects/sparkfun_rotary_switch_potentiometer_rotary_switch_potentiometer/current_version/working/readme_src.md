The Rotary Switch Potentiometer is a board that allows you to add some resistors to our one of our 10-position rotary switches, turning it into a potentiometer with ten discrete steps.  [The hookup guide can be found here.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/rotary-switch-potentiometer-hookup-guide)
