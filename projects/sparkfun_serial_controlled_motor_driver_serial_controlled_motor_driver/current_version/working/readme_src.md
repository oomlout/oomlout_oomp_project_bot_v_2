[*SparkFun Serial Controlled Motor Driver (ROB-13911)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13911)

The expandable SparkFun Serial Controlled Motor Driver allows you to control 2 DC motors using a serial command interface over I2C, SPI, or TTL UART. 

Features:
* User port configurable to SPI, I2C, or UART.
* Expansion port utalizing I2C that allows 16 additional drivers
* Auto-enumeration based on connection of expansion 'In' and 'Out' connections - First board becomes first slave in software.
* 1.5 A peak drive per channel
* Bridging mode for any one board to double current drive.
* Operates from 3 to 11 volts with 12v absolute max.
* Stock 3.3v operation of cpu and signals, with VCC breakable to allow up to 5.5v levels.
