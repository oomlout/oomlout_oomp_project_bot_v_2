The SparkFun Servo Trigger is a small robotics board that simplifies the control of hobby RC servo motors. 
When an external switch or logic signal changes state, the Servo Trigger is able to tell an attached servo motor to move from position A to position B. 
To use the Servo Trigger, you simply connect a hobby servo and a switch, then use the on-board potentiometers to adjust the start/stop positions and the transition time.
