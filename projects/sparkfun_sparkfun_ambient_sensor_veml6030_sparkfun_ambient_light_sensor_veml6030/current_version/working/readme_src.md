[*SparkFun Ambient LIght Sensor - VEML6030 (Qwiic) (SEN-15436)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15436)

The SparkFun Ambient Light Sensor - VEML6030 (Qwiic) is an I<sup>2</sup>C enabled
ambient light sensor with high sensitivity and high accuracy. It reads ambient
light in Lux and boasts a number of nice features including: the ability to set
high and low thresholds for an optional interrupt, power saving features that enable
single digit micro-amp current draw, and a readable  range from zero to 120,000 Lux. We've also written an Arduino 
library that gives full access to all features and includes example code demonstrating all its' abilities (see link below under **Documentation**).
