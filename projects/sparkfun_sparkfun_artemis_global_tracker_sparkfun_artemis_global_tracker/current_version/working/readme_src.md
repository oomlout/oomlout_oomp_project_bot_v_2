[*SparkFun Artemis Global Tracker (WRL-18712)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18712)

The SparkFun Artemis Global Tracker combines the SparkFun Artemis processor with an Iridium 9603N satellite transceiver, ZOE-M8Q GNSS transceiver, and MS8607 PHT sensor to create a truly global tracking and data gathering device in a small form-factor. With a clear view of the sky, this board allows you to send and receive short data messages from anywhere in the world including remote locations like the polar regions, far beyond the reach of WiFi and GSM networks.
