[*SparkFun Qwiic Micro - SAMD21E (DEV-15423)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15423)

Looking for a super small microcontroller to use with the [Qwiic eco-system](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic)? The SparkFun Qwiic Micro is molded to fit our standard 1"x1" Qwiic standard size which makes it one of our smallest micro-controller offerings to date. At it's core is the powerful and versatile ATSAMD21E18, which is an ARM Cortex M0+, 32-bit microcontroller, with 256KB of flash memory that can run at up to 48MHz! It has 12 digital pins which include 5 analog pins, SPI, I²C, and an additional UART data bus as well as a Qwiic connector for easy integration into the Qwiic ecosystem and I²C prototyping.

On the underside of the Qwiic Micro, we've left open pads for a LiPo Battery connector that you can add yourself, if you wish you can make the micro-controller portable. We've also provided pads on the underside for a flash memory chip to maximize the board's memory capacity. The SparkFun Qwiic Micro comes programmed with a UF2 Bootloader making it easy to program with easy driver installation! If you need a tiny but mighty micro-controller for you next project check out the SparkFun Qwiic Micro.
