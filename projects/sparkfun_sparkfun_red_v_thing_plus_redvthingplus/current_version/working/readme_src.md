The SparkFun RED-V (pronounced “red-five”) Thing Plus is a low-cost, development board in our popular Thing Plus footprint and adds in the Freedom E310 core and RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). What sets the RED-V Thing Plus apart is the completely open-source approach from hardware to ISA. That means anyone can make full use the microcontroller without requiring royalties, licenses, or non-disclosure agreements.

It utilizes our handy Qwiic Connect System which means no soldering or shields are required to connect it to the rest of your system with plug-and-play I<sup>2</sup>C functionality. Since the Thing Plus footprint is also Feather-compatible, you can take advantage of a shield option in case you didn't want to use our Qwiic Connect System! Additionally, it comes programmed with a simple bootloader. The modern USB-C connector makes it easy to program via the FE310's NXP K22 ARM Cortex-M4 for USB connectivity and operating as a JTAG interface. For more advanced users who prefer to use the power and speed of professional tools, we've also exposed the JTAG connector.  With so much functionality, the SparkFun RED-V Thing Plus is an ideal choice for your RISC-V project.

The on board Freedom E310 (FE310) is the first member of the Freedom Everywhere family of customizable SoCs from SiFive. Designed for microcontroller, embedded, IoT, and wearable applications, the FE310 features SiFive’s E31 CPU Coreplex, a high-performance, 32-bit RV32IMAC core. Running at 320+ MHz, the FE310 is among the fastest microcontrollers in the market. Additional features include a 16KB L1 Instruction Cache, a 16KB Data SRAM scratchpad, hardware multiply/divide, a debug module, flexible clock generation with on-chip oscillators and PLLs, and a wide variety of peripherals including UARTs, QSPI, PWMs, and timers. Multiple power domains and a low-power standby mode ensure a wide variety of applications can benefit from the FE310. The RED-V Thing Plus requires Freedom Studio software or a Zephyr RTOS build environment set up to program the board and interface with it.
