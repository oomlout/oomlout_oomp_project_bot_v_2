The [SparkFun Thing Plus - ESP32 WROOM (USB-C)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20168) is a comprehensive development platform for [Espressif's ESP32](https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview). Thanks to the onboard ESP32 WROOM module, the SparkFun Thing Plus features 16MB of flash memory, 520kB of internal SRAM, an integrated 802.11 BGN WiFi transceiver and dual-mode Bluetooth capabilities, a JST connector to plug in a LiPo battery, a Qwiic connector, and 21 I/O pins. Add to that a rich set of peripherals ranging from capacitive touch sensors, Hall sensors, SD card interface, Ethernet, high-speed SPIs, UARTs, I2S, and I<sup>2</sup>C.

We took all the good from the original [ESP32 Thing Plus](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663) and sprinkled on some more. We upgraded to a USB-C connector that provides up to 2A of power, added a fuel gauge IC that will make sure you know your battery levels, included a NeoPixel (WS2812C) RGB LED is the perfect multi-status indicator, and threw a microSD connector on the back! Oh, and the new taller reset and boot buttons are **so** much easier to push! We even dedicated a voltage regulator to the Qwiic connector, which enables software power control to the Qwiic bus - great for low power logging!
