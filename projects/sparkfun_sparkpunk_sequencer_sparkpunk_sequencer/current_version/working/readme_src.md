The SparkPunk Sequencer is a musical control voltage sequencer designed to control the 
[SparkPunk Sound Generator](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11177). 
With the pair, you can create ten-step musical motifs, but there are hidden opportunities in the sequencer: 
it can be modified and connected to external hardware in clever and interesting ways. 

Board comes as a soldering kit.
