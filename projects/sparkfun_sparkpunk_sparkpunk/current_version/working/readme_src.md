The SparkPunk kit Is a simple synthesizer that you assemble yourself.  If you're into circuit bending, there are also a bunch of mods you can do to the board.

The [hookup guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkpunk-hookup-guide) has instructions for assembly, and recommends the first few mods you can consider.

This kit was created in Eagle v6.5.0, with design simulations run in [LTSpice](http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/#LTspice).
