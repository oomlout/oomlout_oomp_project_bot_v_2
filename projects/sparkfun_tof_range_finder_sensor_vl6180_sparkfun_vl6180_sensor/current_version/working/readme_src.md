[*SparkFun ToF Range Finder Sensor-VL6180 (SEN-12785)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12785)

This is the SparkFun “Time-of-Flight” Range Finder, a sensor board for the VL6180 distance sensor. 
Unlike most distance sensors that rely on reflected light intensity or reflected angles to determine range, 
the VL6180 uses a precise clock to measure the time it takes light to bounce back from a surface.
