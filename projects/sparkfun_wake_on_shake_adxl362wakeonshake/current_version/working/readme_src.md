The Wake-on-Shake, based on a concept by Nitzan Gadish of Analog Devices, combines the ATTiny2313A with the ADXL362 
low-power accelerometer to cut power to your project for long periods of time, all the while waiting for a shake or a bump and sipping <2uA at 3.7V

Wake-on-Shake firmware was compiled in WinAVR-20100110.  
Arduino example sketch was compiled in Arduino 1.6. 
Hardware was developed in EAGLE 6.3.0.
