[*SparkFun Wireless Motor Driver Shield (DEV-14285)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14285)
Arduino shield with built-in motor driver and XBee slot.

This is an Arduino shield that integrates an H-Bridge Driver and breaks out 
all I/O ports to three-pin headers on a GND / PWR / SIG standard. This enables quick
prototyping and integration of Arduino projects without the need of a breadboard.

This board contains an XBee header for adding wireless capability to your Arduino projects. A switch for 
SW_Serial ties the TX/RX lines to pins A0 and A1 on the Arduino board. 

This shield is a perfect addition to building up a simiple robotics platform with an
Arduino board. Two switches allow you to select which power source is used to power the motors and/or servos.
See [the hookup guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/wireless-motor-driver-shield-hookup-guide#hardware-overview) for a chart showing the various switch configurations.

**Note:** If connected to your Arduino, the switch must be set to SW_Serial in order to program your board.
