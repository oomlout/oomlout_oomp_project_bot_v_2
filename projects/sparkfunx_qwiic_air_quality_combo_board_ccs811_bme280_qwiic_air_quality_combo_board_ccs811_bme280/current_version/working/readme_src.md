[*SPX-14241*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14241)

This combo board is the first of its kind to provide a variety of environmental data including barometric pressure, humidity, temperature, TVOCs, and CO2 levels, all over an easy to use I2C bus. The CCS811 is a very popular and very new TVOC and CO2 sensor. It has a feature that allows it to tune its internal algorithm and improve its readings if you provide the sensor with current humidity and temperature. Fortunately, the BME280 is an awesome sensor that outputs humidity, barometric pressure, and temperature. We decided to stick both on an easy to use board. We provide example code showing how to read humidity and pressure data from the BME280 and then transmit that data back to the CCS811 for improved TVOC and CO2 detection.

The [Qwiic system](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) enables fast and solderless connection between popular platforms and various sensors and actuators. You can read more about the Qwiic system [here](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).
