The Qwiic Keyboard Explorer is a 14-key mechanical keyboard kit based on our Qwiic Pro Micro development board. On its own, it makes a conveniently sized programmable macro pad, but we've also included plenty of prototyping space along the top for experimenting with all kinds of keyboard peripherals. If soldering isn't your thing, take advantage of the Pro Micro's Qwiic connector to attach any board from our Qwiic ecosystem! The standoff holes surrounding the prototyping area are spaced to accommodate most Qwiic boards for convenient mounting.
