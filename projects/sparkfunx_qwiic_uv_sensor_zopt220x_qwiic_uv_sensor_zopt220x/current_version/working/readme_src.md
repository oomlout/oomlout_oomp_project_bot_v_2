[*SPX-14264*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14264)

The ZOPT2201 is an excellent UVBS (ultraviolet energy sensor) in that it does true 310nm UVB sensing, not interpolated UV from ambient light like most sensors on the market. Without fuss or weird look up tables this sensor gives the current UV Index accurately.

The [Qwiic system](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) enables fast and solderless connection between popular platforms and various sensors and actuators. You can read more about the Qwiic system [here](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).
