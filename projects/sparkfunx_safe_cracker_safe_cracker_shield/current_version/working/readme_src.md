![SparkFun Safe Cracker](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/6/5/1/Cracked_Safe.jpg)

A robot with some tricks to open combination safes.

We were able to crack our Craigslist safe in 40 minutes and 42 seconds! You can [re-watch the live cracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsVSEHv2N4M) if you'd like. The magic moment occurs at [45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsVSEHv2N4M&t=45m10s) but start around [44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsVSEHv2N4M&t=44m30s) to get the full scope of what's going on.
