Itâ€™s 2pm on a Tuesday and you find yourself at the test house with a design failing an emissions test. You quickly determine that you need to hack a filter onto your design but there is no space to do so. If only you had a simple board you could attach to the product. Introducing the Pi-Filter! This simple board gets the name Pi-Filter from its shape, which resembles the Greek letter Pi. It has two shunt capacitors with an inductor in between. In this C-L-C configuration, a person can quickly implement a low pass filter.
