MicroPython based robot designed for openness, flexibility, and education.

## Design
The PiBot is designed for simplicity, but also expandability. It is based on MicroPython at its core
and features simple to use pre-made APIs to interface with the hardware, allowing for easy design of
your robot.

## Hardware
The PiBot uses:
 - a mk20dx256vlh7 processor, just like the teensy 3.1 and 3.2
 - a MC33926PNB motor driver
 - pololu motors + encoders (for beta unit)
